# Developer Console ‚ÄúTop-Up‚Äù RFP

- **Goal**  
  Developer-Console accounts occasionally run out of credits ($CERE tokens) needed to enjoy an uninterrupted service by the cluster. The **Top-Up** micro-service will detect a low-balance event (or a user request) and automatically fund the account, so builders never hit a hard stop.

- **Scope of Work**  
  1. **Event Listener** ‚Äì listens to Decentralized Data Cluster (DDC) for `BalanceLow` events and to an HTTP endpoint for manual top-up requests.  
  2. **Ramp integration** ‚Äì trigger an external ramp service that in turn delivers the $CERE tokens into the user account
  3. **Credit Card Authorisation** ‚Äì manage credit authorisation by storing a token securily in a database, enable automated top-ups by credit card 

- **Deliverables**  
  * Source code  under `cluster-apps/apps/developer-console/topup-service/`  
  * Unit & e2e tests (‚â• 90 % line coverage)
  * E2E flow video recording 
  * README quick-start (below) and change-log  

- **Success criteria**  
  * A fresh account with ‚â§ threshold balance is automatically replenished within **5 seconds** (can be on testnet).  
  * The full test suite passes in CI; container image publishes to GitHub Packages; Helm install works out-of-the-box.

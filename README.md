# Developer Console ‚ÄúTop-Up‚Äù RFP

- **Goal**
  We need a service that can top-up user accounts by charging a stored credit card and triggering the on-chain transaction through an external ramp service. The **Top-Up** micro-service listen to a low-balance event (or a user request) and automatically fund the account, so builders never hit a hard stop.

- **Scope of Work**
    1. **I/O**
       - Input: amount, wallet_id, Credit Card authorisation token
       - Data stored: Vault-tokenised credit-card auth (PCI-DSS SAQ-A)
       - Processing: Charge card ‚Üí receive auth-ID ‚Üí call external ramp service for on-chain top-up
       - Output ‚Üí ‚ÄúJSON {tx_hash, timestamp} + webhook callback‚Äù
    2. **Trigger & Listener**
       - Event source: low-balance webhook
       - Listener: top-up endpoint
    3. **Ramp integration**
       - trigger an external ramp service that in turn delivers the $CERE tokens into the user account (can be a placeholder contract/wallet)
    5. **Credit Card Authorisation**
       - manage credit authorisation by storing a token securily in a database, enabling automated top-ups by pre-authorising the credit card
      
  **Estimated development time**: 1 day

- **Deliverables**  
  * Source code  under `cluster-apps/apps/developer-console/topup-service/`  
  * Unit & e2e tests (‚â• 90 % line coverage)
  * E2E flow video recording 
  * README quick-start (below) and change-log  

- **Success criteria**  
  * A fresh account with ‚â§ threshold balance is automatically replenished within **5 seconds** (can be on testnet).  
  * The full test suite passes in CI; container image publishes to GitHub Packages; Helm install works out-of-the-box.

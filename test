## Abstract

Build a production‚Äëready **multi‚Äëagent pipeline** that ingests raw customer‚Äëservice audio at scale and converts it into structured insights end‚Äëto‚Äëend: **time‚Äëaligned transcripts**, **semantic context trees**, **time‚Äëseries sentiment**, and **trigger flags** connected to searchable records and dashboards.

The system runs from **audio intake ‚Üí queued processing ‚Üí agent orchestration ‚Üí persistence ‚Üí APIs/UI**, reusing the Cere stack: **A6 E2E test harness**, **A8 NLP modules**, and **ROB primitives (RAFTs, Cubbies, Object Store)**. Acceptance is defined by unit/e2e tests, quantitative quality targets (WER, F1/AUROC), and operational SLAs. Public docs that inform the approach: [A6 ‚Ä¢ NLP Processor Lab](https://cere.notion.site/NLP-Processor-Lab-27ed800083d680aa9553e6fa83c6024b), [A8 ‚Ä¢ NLP Use‚ÄëCase Resources](https://cere.notion.site/NLP-Use-Case-resources-27fd800083d680f7a383c7d029e9f4c0), and [ROB Dev Onboarding](https://cere.notion.site/ROB-Platform-Developer-Onboarding-Guide-eaa8764057c547f7a950e003469bb4be).

## Future Plans

* **Sustainability:** convert to managed service/extension marketplace; continue eval data curation; add near‚Äëreal‚Äëtime streaming and multilingual models.
* **Adoption:** publish sample datasets, tutorials, and a hosted demo; explore partner deployments within the Cere ecosystem.
* **Roadmap (post‚Äëgrant):** multi‚Äëtenant auth, cost dashboards, improved diarization, real‚Äëtime agent loop for live triggers, and CSV/BI exports.

## Preferred method of funds delivery

* **USDC on Eth address:** `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (placeholder)
  *or*
* **USD/EUR Fiat**

**Link to Logo image 1:1 (in GitHub)**
`https://github.com/gharibyan/project-vox` (add `/assets/logo.png` when available)

**Other Bio and details or thoughts, etc.**

* Primary focus is a robust pipeline with measurable quality. Evaluation plan emphasizes synthetic audio generation with controlled noise to stress ASR and sentiment stages; results tracked in the dashboard and compared against gold labels.
